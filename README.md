# StopwatchProject(Using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT)
New repo
This code sets up a basic stop watch that starts, stops, and resets the timer. When you run the HTML file in your browser, you should see a simple stop watch interface with "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons. The timer will start counting when you click "Start" and stop when you click "Stop." The "Reset" button will reset the timer to 00:00:00.

When the page loads, it displays a timer with "00:00:00" and three buttons: "Start," "Stop," and "Reset."
When the "Start" button is clicked, the stopwatch starts counting up from "00:00:00." The "Start" button is disabled, and the "Stop" and "Reset" buttons are enabled.
When the "Stop" button is clicked, the stopwatch stops counting, and the current time is displayed. The "Stop" button is disabled, and the "Start" and "Reset" buttons are enabled.
When the "Reset" button is clicked, the stopwatch is reset to "00:00:00." All buttons return to their initial state.

The project provides a simple and interactive way to simulate a stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can start, stop, and reset the timer, making it a basic but functional stopwatch application.
