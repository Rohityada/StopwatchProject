# StopwatchProject(Using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT)
New repo
This code sets up a basic stop watch that starts, stops, and resets the timer. When you run the HTML file in your browser, you should see a simple stop watch interface with "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons. The timer will start counting when you click "Start" and stop when you click "Stop." The "Reset" button will reset the timer to 00:00:00.
